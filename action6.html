				<div id="game-info" class="description"><p>Batman: Arkham (also commonly known by the fan-originated term Arkhamverse) is a series of action-adventure video games based on the DC Comics character Batman, developed by Rocksteady Studios[1][2] and WB Games Montr√©al, and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The first two Rocksteady games were written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini and featured voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively, from the DC Animated Universe (DCAU). Conroy and Hamill returned to voice their characters in the fourth main installment of the series, Batman: Arkham Knight.</p><p>The first game, Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), focuses on Batman trying to prevent the Joker from destroying Gotham City after he takes control of Arkham Asylum, and he is forced to contend with numerous other villains he has incarcerated along the way. The second game, Arkham City (2011), is set a year later, after Professor Hugo Strange expands Arkham into a massive super-prison enclosing a neglected segment of Gotham City; Batman is incarcerated and must uncover the secret behind Strange's sinister scheme, "Protocol 10", while slowly dying from an illness inflicted by the Joker. The third game, Batman: Arkham Origins (2013), serves as a prequel set several years before Arkham Asylum, in which a younger and less-refined Batman must deal with eight deadly assassins contracted to kill him by crime lord Black Mask on Christmas Eve, while also encountering the Joker for the first time. The fourth installment, Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), is Rocksteady's conclusion to the series. Set 9 months after the events of Arkham City, Arkham Knight sees Batman facing Scarecrow along with the mysterious Arkham Knight (and his militia), who have seized control of Gotham City in a plan to destroy Batman, both physically and mentally. The franchise has also seen the release of various mobile games, and a virtual reality game, Batman: Arkham VR, also developed by Rocksteady.</p></div>
